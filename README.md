# Hospital Waiting Time Analysis
In this project, we worked with a dataset containing hospital waiting times in the Lisbon region. The goal was to address the average waiting times for a pacient using ML techniques in streaming. Regarding the data, we will focus on observations from Santa Maria Hospital, as it contains the most observations (395,858) and fewer types of urgencies (only general and pediatric urgencies).

The challenge primarily focused on developing a predictive model for waiting time based on bracelet color and time of day. Hospital waiting times represent deviations from normalcy. For example, during the winter, when flu crises are common, hospitals already have more people to attend to, so waiting times take this into account. Any deviations from these expected patterns contribute to waiting times.

# Structure
This project was divided into two parts where the first paper corresponded to an extended abstract and the second paper to the EDA of the data along with the development of the different methods. These were linear regression, Hoeffding tree, Hoeffding Apdative Drift and ensemble methods that combined these models.
